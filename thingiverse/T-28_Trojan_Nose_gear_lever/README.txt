# Summary

I made this to replace the broken one on my plane.  It is rough and needed some filing, but works.  The holes came out smaller than designed so I needed to drill them out.  For the screw, I heated the screw and screwed in it melted the PLA enough to produce a really clean and tight thread.  What can I say it was quick but it works.  Included the .STEP file if someone wants to tidy it up more.
