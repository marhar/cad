# Summary

This is reference hardware design for the Donkey Self Driving car which is being raced in the diyrobocars.com league.  For directions on how to build, BOM and setting up software go to https://github.com/wroscoe/donkey

9/12 edits - Changed screw hole size for servo driver board and gave more clearance for chassis pins.  This should make assembly easier

8/23 edits - I modified the parts slightly to allow more room for the pins on the base plate, added battery straps, and enlarged and moved the screw holes for the camera (Note - the camera hole pattern now matches the wide-angle camera and is now wrong for an official RPI camera)

Printing tips - Print in PLA or ABS.  The roll cage should be printed with the "legs" up in the air.  Depending on your printer holes may need to be drilled after printing.

Also included is a .dxf file if you want to laser cut a top plate.
