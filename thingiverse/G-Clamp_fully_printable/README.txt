# Summary

Small G-Clamp fully printable without support.
Additional a larger frame and screw is provided which adds another centimeter.
The protector can be reused for the larger clamp.

The screw has a fair amount of space, so it should fit without problems into the frame screw hole. Should anyone still have an issue let me know and i can provide an additional version.

The best way to mount the protector is to use the clamp itself by closing the clamp until the screw ball and protector ball joint clicks together or use your thumb.

For my requirements i used only 25% (~3 hour print) because i need just to hold things in place while the glue is drying. For more force 100% infill is recommended and don't forget it's not made of steel.

Enjoy :)
