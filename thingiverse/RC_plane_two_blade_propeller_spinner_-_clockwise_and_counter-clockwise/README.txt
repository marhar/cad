# Summary

This adaptation of Aero330's spinner makes use of his lovely tongue and groove method of aligning the parts, but gets rid of the open slot for the screws that I could never get on with.  The tiny screws always fell inside the spinner before I could get them started in the locating holes.  This design moves the screw holes to the outside rim of the spinner making a cleaner end result.

There's a clockwise and counter-clockwise version for twin engined planes.  The usual one to print would, of course, be the counter-clockwise one

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerBot
Printer: MakerBot Replicator 
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 40%

Notes: 
Once printed, pop the two parts together and using the holes as guides, drill 1mm holes through the tongue.  Use the screws that come with servos to fasten the parts together once they are on the prop shaft.

# Post-Printing

## A suggested improvement

Paint the spinner with acetone to fix the layers together more firmly.  The spinner is only thin and you can crush it easily whilst assembling it.

# How I Designed This

I used the Curviloft plugin in Sketchup to repair the original screw holes in the spinner.
