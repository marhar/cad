# Summary

Being that the Monoprice Mini Select/Malyan M200 is so small, it's easy to move around and bring back and forth to the shop.  Carrying it was awkward, bed sliding everywhere.  So I found a handle on here and remixed it so it fits 2 of the M3 screws on the top of the tower.

I bought a package of M3x22mm socket head screws from Home Depot and they worked perfect.  I saved the washer from the 2 screws removed from the tower and used them on the new screws.

This is remixed from this design:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12695

***UPDATE***
I made a slight modification to the height of the legs, I was hitting my knuckles sometimes on the filament feeder.  I added 4mm to the height which should add a little bit of clearance.  

***UPDATE***
The new height is perfect, no more knuckle hitting.  Recommend a small dab of removable loctite on the screws.

I've uploaded v2.1 which also has a notch cut out for clearance.

***UPDATE***

Took out the ribs.  I hated them.  So did other people.  Nice and round now.
